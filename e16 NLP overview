Commercial product: ServiceNow chatbot

When it comes to making requests inside a company for new equipment or to learn about HR policies, 
it can be a frustrating experience for both sides of the equation. 
HR and IT are probably tired of answering the same questions. 

Employees are tired of calling a help desk for routine inquiries and waiting for answers. 
ServiceNow’s new bot-building technology is designed to alleviate that problem by providing a way 
to create an automated bot-driven process for routine requests.

**Use Cases:
This commercial product uses NLP techniques in the following way:
For example, if you tell the bot you need a new phone, it can pull your records, understand what you currently have
and order a new one all in the same interaction — and all within a common messaging interface such as Slack or Microsoft Teams.

It also works for customer service transactions to process routine customer inquiries without having to route them 
to a CSR to answer typical questions.

The company claims that using these chatbots, customers can reduce call volume to help desks and customer service by 15-20 percent, 
using the standard argument that it should free humans to handle more difficult inquiries.
